Guess and Connect
Developed By: Emil Jacob

This is a game which teaches many kids about various animals, through the use of pictures loaded in a canvas, and various dots to connect them together. 
This can be done by the use of two particular options:
•	The use of multiple choices, out of which one is the correct option.
•	The use of a text field, in which the player has to input the correct answer. 
(Note: this answer must be written with the first letter in capital. For this reason, the multiple-choice option is preferred for beginners).

This app is built on basic HTML and Javascript and uses a canvas for sketching.

Once you type your answer, you can click the “Submit” button to submit your answer.
This Submit button will load a window which will tell you if you are correct or wrong.

There are 20 pictures in each mode. Can you guess them all?
If so, then GOOD LUCK!
