Guess and Connect

This is a game which teaches many kids about various animals, through the use of pictures, and various dots to connect them together. 
This can be done by the use of two particular options:
•	The use of multiple choices, out of which one is the correct option.
•	The use of a text field, in which the player has to input the correct answer. 
(Note: this answer must be written with the first letter in capital. For this reason, the multiple-choice option is preferred for beginners).

Once you type your answer, you can click the “Submit” button to submit your answer.
This app is built on basic HTML and Javascript and uses a canvas for sketching. 
This canvas initially loads an image for the players to use. 
Once a particular image is done (i.e., when the player correctly answers which animal is displayed,), it will load the next image.
